Focus on your business and don’t waste time reading emails to confirm reservations manually. ReDi Restaurant Reservation is a fully automated reservation system. Everything is done without human involvement.

You may easily handle reservations for your restaurant using the ReDi Restaurant Reservation plugin. This plugin facilitates online customer reservations, your clients can view available space at a predetermined time and make reservations with instant confirmation.
Simply, configure the maximum number of reservations per person, the hours of operation, and the restaurant information. That’s it!

So. looking for the fastest and most simple restaurant reservation WordPress plugin? You are in the right place!

Get the plugin downloaded first. The process is quite simple.

* Go to your WordPress website from the backend. 
* Click on Plugins > Add New. 
* On the search line, type “ReDi Restaurant Reservation.”
* Click on Install > Activate. 

Start your WordPress restaurant reservation page, **with 3 steps:**

* Register & Generate/Create the API key.
* Check the new Reservation page (it automatically creates a reservation page after registration).
* Make all the necessary configurations and customizations.


It is not unexpected that there is an increase in demand for online restaurant reservations because most of us spend more than 24 hours per week using our mobile devices. So a **credible restaurant reservation system** is a must for a successful business, don’t you agree?

The benefits of using a restaurant reservation system, such as ReDi, are numerous:

* **Increase Conversion Rates:** Extensive and catchy CTA’s (calls to action) help to increase conversions and offer visitors immediate restaurant reservations.
* **Save Time:** As far as ReDi is fully automated it will save a lot of time from your workers, which can be used on other things.
* **Additional Analytics:** Track the website visitors and reservation data to make more result-based decisions for your business.
* **Satisfied Clients:** In the age of technology clients prefer to have everything easy and quick at hand. That’s why online restaurant reservations will greatly boost customer satisfaction.
* **Capture Abandoning Customers:** Without an instant reservation confirmation, a visitor will most probably go to a few more restaurants to make a reservation. Thus, the restaurant may lose that client.

== REDI RESTAURANT RESERVATION PLUGIN FEATURES, ADD-ONS, AND ADVANTAGES ==

= KEY FEATURES =
The ReDi Restaurant Reservation plugin works well for all types of businesses, including little cafés, bars, and large restaurants. The plugin includes several helpful functions and highlights.
